                Constant micro electrical power systems (CMEPS) have
                revolutionized the way we think about alternative energy
                sources. One of the great things about this innovation is that
                it doesn't need any outsourcing.The CMEPS energy process is
                accelerated and produced by a machine which allows it to be
                performed at any time and location. It is the perfect innovation
                to have power at all times and in any place, as outsourcing is
                not needed. It is power everywhere you go as far as the device
                is with you. This makes power available globally, even to
                locations without the grid; all you need is your CMEPS.
