                The constant electric power energy system device is here to
                transform U.S. energy consumption from fossil fuels to a
                reliable and constant renewable energy system. The innovation is
                not limited to the United States alone but also helps
                developing, and under-developed countries access constant power
                supply with or without the grid. The primary goal of the device
                is to decarbonize the United States and help reach the targeted
                goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
