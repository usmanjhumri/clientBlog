            The fact that one cubic meter of the SHAKARZAHI constant electric
            power energy invention can generate 100kWh of electricity—far more
            than it can with nuclear, solar, or fuel-based energy sources—is
            another remarkable fact about it. Since electricity powers
            practically all of our everyday activities, our need for it is
            boundless. An energy source that can provide up to 100kWh of
            electricity is a notable development in the power sector. We would
            want to see life get better as a result of this. Our goal is to
            hasten the transition to a more sustainable energy future. Our goal
            is to offer the world power system the much-needed alternative while
            safeguarding the environment and ensuring everyone has electricity
            access.
