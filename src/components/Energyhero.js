              People's perspectives on energy have changed due to environmental
              concerns, economic conditions, and energy security. Finding clean
              and sustainable alternative energy sources for future generations
              will be essential and crucial. On the environmental front, it is
              becoming universally acknowledged that steps must be made to
              reduce greenhouse gas emissions as climate change evidence becomes
              more apparent. According to data from the Energy Information
              Administration, the largest generator of carbon dioxide emissions
              in the U.S. is the transportation sector, which accounts for up to
              33.1 percent of all energy-related emissions. This demonstrates
              the pressing need for the American transportation industry to take
              action to reduce emissions.

              People switching to electric vehicles is an excellent approach to
              reducing our carbon footprints. However, E.V.s still needs a
              better storage system to facilitate its worldwide utilization. The
              challenges faced by different electric vehicles are limited range,
              charging time, and the need for charging stations which can be
              majorly attributed to the battery storage system. Fortunately, the
              constant electric power energy system eliminates these challenges
              as our device doesn't require a storage system and can be
              conveniently installed in EVs to ensure an uninterrupted power
              supply. With this device, E.V.s will have unlimited range flow as
              the device provides a constant supply of power even in motion.
              Also, it will eradicate the time needed for charging E.V.s and the
              need for installing charging stations. Once the device is
              installed, E.V.s will have access to an unlimited supply of power
              that ensures continuous usage with power interruptions. This
              device is here to change the Electro-mobility industry and enhance
              their performances significantly.
